# Automated Data Discovery and Profiling in Social Network Analysis:

This project, carried out by Mario Lamas and Pablo Leger√©n and which constitutes the Master's Thesis in Big Data Science, explores the use of automated data discovery and profiling techniques to manage the quality, integrity,
and structure of data in the context of social network analysis. 

The main goal is to develop a system capable of automatically analyzing large volumes of social network data, identifying key attributes, and generating comprehensive reports that can guide decision-making processes. The project will involve the development and testing of an innovative data profiling and discovery tool, as well as the implementation and deployment of the tool in a real-world
scenario. The results of this study have important implications for the field of social network analysis, as they can help researchers, analysts, and organizations to make more informed decisions based on accurate and up-to-date data
